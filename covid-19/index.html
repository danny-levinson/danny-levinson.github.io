<p>
We all want to know answers to questions like: "how many people are going to die", "how long will we be under emergency measures", "am I going to get the dreaded lurgi", and "what happens next?".
<p>
Definitive answers are not to be had of course, but thanks to the excellent articles by Tomas Pueyo (<a href="https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca">Why You Must Act Now</a>, and <a href=" https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56">The Hammer and the Dance</a>) and an epidemic simulator I found via the first of those (<a href="http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/">http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/</a>), we can make some very approximate predictions for Alberta.
</p>

<h4>What does social distancing do?</h4>
<p>
I plugged some simple assumptions into the simulator: population is about 4 million, the virus has been circulating since February 1 (day 0), initial reproduction factor is 2.2, reproduction after social distancing was brought in is 0.75, and social distancing started on March 15 (day 43) and I checked that the graphs generated concur roughly with the reported cases in Alberta.  
The reproduction factor after distancing and the days since epidemic onset that distancing was begun are the critical factors. The reproduction factor is the average number of other people directly infected by an infected person.
Here is the graph of new infections per day.
</p>

<p>
This graph shows the actual number of infections in the community under the assumptions of the model.
The vertical black line labelled <i>Intervention</i> marks the day on which social distancing begins.
Notice that actual infections start to drop within just two days.
This will happen regardless of any other assumptions provided only that we can bring the reproduction factor below 1.0.
</p>

<h4>When will we see infections starting to drop?</h4>
<p>
We can't see actual infections; we only get to see infections when they are reported and tested.
So the actual infections per day do not correspond directly to the numbers of infections reported by Alberta Health (<a href="https://covid19stats.alberta.ca/#case-counts">Case counts</a>).
We don't see an infection during it's incubation period (5-14 days) and it may well not be reported for some days after that. Add to that that testing was just being ramped up for the first few days, and also that many people may be mildly sick but because they have voluntarily self-isolated themselves, we have not been testing them as it wouldn't change their treatment. 
</p>
<p>
The result is that reported cases lag actual cases by a number of days and may appear to exceed actual cases somewhat as well.
Here is a comparison of graphs of cases in Hubei by date of diagnosis (i.e. reporting, in orange) and by date of onset of symptoms (blue). I am taking the latter as an approximation to numbers of actual cases.
</p>
<center><img src="g2.png" alt="graph of data from Hubei" width="85%"></center>
<p>
The lag between the two peaks in the Hubei graph is about 9 days.
Add to that that infections generally do not show any symptoms for 5 days,
and that actual infections will not drop till 2-4 days after distancing measures are introduced.
The result is that we should only see reported infections beginning to drop 16 days after the intervention.
The intervention took place in Alberta on March 15.
If our measures have been sufficiently strict, we should see cases reported begin to drop by the end of March.
<p>
I am ignoring the excess and assuming that if there were, say, 49 new cases reported on March 21 then there were 49 actual cases ten days earlier on March 11 (aka day 39). I moved the start date of my model to make the numbers approximately match the progression so far in Alberta.
</p>
</p>

<h4>How many people are going to die?</h4>
<p>
The epidemic calculator will also show us the numbers of hospitalisations and deaths:
</p>
<center><img src="g3.png" alt="graph from model with hospitalisations and deaths" width="85%"></center>
<p>
Note that these are all daily numbers showing people in a particular condition on one day, not cumulative numbers. However the numbers of deaths are cumulative because people stay dead once they die.
</p>
<p>
We can get cumulative numbers just by adding up the numbers from the beginning. I haven't gone to that trouble as I want to get this note out there as soon as I can. Besides the two things that really matter are: first, the number of deaths we have to anticipate; and secondly, the peak number of people hospitalised at any time. According to the model, if I've made the right assumptions, Alberta can expect about 30 deaths over the course of the epidemic and the peak in hospitalisations is about 120. That seems manageable and the low number is attributable to the speed with which our governments have reacted.
</p>
<p>
In Alberta so far there have only been 11 <a href="https://covid19stats.alberta.ca/#case-counts">hospitalisations</a> (with 6 ICU admissions) but there are 226 reported cases.
The model assumes, based on evidence from places such as Hubei, that the hospitalisation rate is 20%.
That would mean 44 hospitalisations in Alberta.
How can we explain the discrepancy?
There are several possible reasons to pick from: first, hospitalisations lag onset of symptoms (and hence diagnosis) by several days; secondly, with so few hospitalisations it may just be a fluke; also, Alberta has a younger demographic than many other places; or lastly, it may just be that we have been lucky that no senior centres have yet been infected in Alberta.
The age distribution of cases in Alberta (see <a href="https://covid19stats.alberta.ca/">characteristics</a> shows a bulge in the 35-44 year age range, which is atypical.
</p>

<h4>Am I going to get sick?</h4>
<p>
The other thing we would like to know is the risk of us personally getting infected. For this we need to know the cumulative number of cases and, in the absence of any information about whether we are, say, more or less likely to interact with people who travel, we can just divide that by the size of the total population. As I said I haven't attempted to derive cumulative graphs from the model, but estimating using the 2% death rate built into the model, the total number of cases should be around 1500, which means our raw probability of getting infected is just 0.04%.
</p>

<h4>What happens if R is not brought down to 0.75</h4>
<p>
Once again, my estimates here are extremely rough. The model is very sensitive to exactly how far the epidemic had progressed when distancing measures were brought in. There is also the critical but so far entirely unknown value of R.  R is the reproduction rate - how many people on average will become infected from each infected carrier. I chose 0.75 because I read that for Wuhan, which has now defeated the virus (for the time being), scientists calculated R for their very severe distancing regime as 0.34. I am hoping that with our less severe restrictions we can still achieve an R as small as twice that of Wuhan.
</p>
<p>
Suppose that we achieve an R of only 0.95 instead of 0.75. The number of infections per day will still rise to the same peak of about 110 per day. The number of hospitalisations will go up to about 180 instead of 120, but the epidemic will last considerably longer and the number of deaths will rise from 30 to more than 75. The cumulative number of infections rises from 1500 to about 4000.
</p>
<center><img src="g4.png" alt="graph from model of infections with R=0.95" width="85%"></center>
<p>
Suppose we don't achieve an R value below 1. Let's say we bring it down to only 1.05 instead. In that case, the epidemic is not stopped at all. After 220 days the number of new cases per day is still rising and the virus will, in time, inexorably infect every susceptible in the population. This could take a number of years as we are still getting only 400 infections per day after 6 months. Nevertheless it is not a very satisfactory conclusion and if it turns out to be the real situation we can expect the powers that be to bring in even more draconian distancing measures.
</p>
<center><img src="g5.png" alt="graph from model of infections with R=1.06" width="85%"></center>

<h4>When will we know if our distancing measures are working?</h4>
<p>
The next thing to know is when will we find out whether our social distancing measures are working. If we were successful in reducing R below 1.0, the number of actual infections per day should peak about 2-4 days after the distancing measures were introduced. Symptom onset follows after 5 or so days, and the number of observed new cases will peak about 10 days after that. If we take March 15 as the date we introduced social distancing, that means we should start to see a drop in new cases by the end of March.
In fact, we introduced some measures even earlier than March 15 (selective isolations, no large gatherings) so we might see a drop starting even sooner. The drop in reported cases today (March 21) was encouraging, but of course we should not try to extrapolate from just a single data point.
</p>
<p>
How fast the drop proceeds if and when it starts will tell us quickly how low we have managed to reduce R. We should know that well enough within three days after the peak.  R, in turn, tells us how long the epidemic will last before petering out. In the 0.75 case, we should see the number of new actual daily infections go down to 5 after about 3 months and to 1 after a further 3 months.
</p>
<p>
Our model is somewhat pessimistic in at least one respect: we have assumed all reported cases are community transmissions. In fact, many of the new cases have been imported directly from outside Alberta. The first reported community transmission was March 15, so perhaps actual community transmission didn't get started till much later than the February 1 date we assumed. In that case we might be in a much better position. I'll leave that determination to people with access to more sophisticated modelling software.
</p>

<h4>How long does our lockdown have to last?</h4>
<p>
The R=0.75 model tells us the epidemic gets down to a handful of new cases a day after 3 months and peters out altogether after 6 months. 
In fact, the more severely we restrict contact now, the sooner we can relax the restrictions. We will have to maintain vigilance though, and if new cases escape into the community after we introduce relaxations then we will have to reintroduce restrictions in a hurry.
Above all, outbound travel restrictions aren't going to go away until all countries have brought the epidemic under control or have had it burn out. Isolation for returning travellers will also be with us for a long time. In South Korea, the first 30 cases imported from China were traced and contained. Case 31, however, was missed and gave rise indirectly to more than 2000 consequent infections (<a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-SOUTHKOREA-CLUSTERS/0100B5G33SB/index.html">2019 coronavirus: The Korean clusters</a>).
</p>

<h4>So are we going to be stuck with repeated distancing episodes forever?</h4>
<p>
I don't think this epidemic will go on forever, or even for more that a year.
Although we do not know if Coronaviruses mutate annually the way flu viruses do
it is encouraging to note that the 1918 flu burned itself out over a year and has not come back.
</p>
<p>
We also have teams of scientists investigating remediation all over the world. Every anti-viral ever developed is being tested (and there are thousands of them).
Strides are being made in vaccine development. Even a poor vaccine could be enough to lower R in a population below 1. 
</p>
<p>
Developments in fast and cheaper testing can also be effective in slowing the epidemic and keeping it under control as in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and now China.
For example, using fast testing, intense tracing efforts, and quarantine for travellers, as well as strong public health measures such as taking people's temperature every day and eating meals separated by plastic shields, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/taiwan-covid-19-lessons-1.5505031?fbclid=IwAR2jlTK0kWPnerGANGt_4fPbLqeiYS9tq-JyKCmRuKvycxpw846diKmo5D0">Taiwan</a> has been able to maintain an active economy despite some daily infections.
I am sure that it helped that the vice-president of Taiwan is an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-asia-acted-west-dithered-hong-kong-taiwan-europe">epidemiologist</a>!
</p>
<p>
Further, work is being done on detecting antibodies to the new Coronavirus. 
That will enable us to assay a population and find the true rate of immunity and hence the susceptibility to another outbreak.
Any one of these measures successfully implemented could enable us to finally say goodbye to this scourge.
